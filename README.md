Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'deep learning' with 'derp learning'

This is a simple fork of cloud to butt (https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt/). The only difference here is we replace 'deep learning' with 'derp learning' instead of cloud to butt.

This idea was inspired by the genius of Chris Fisher on the [Linux Action Show](https://youtu.be/phD552PshN0?t=1m38s),
via the awesome [Jupiter Broadcasting Network](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/)

Get Ready for the future, derp learning is here!
